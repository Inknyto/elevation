revert the default mode to light mode in DarkMode.js

set the currentView and previousView as context so that they will be
accessible throughout the app

Use material ui for the single result containers (and why not material dividers for
each line)

Use material design labels for the skills 

maybe remove the memoization of the requests(seems that it returns incorrect
search results, might replace it with setting a delay for each request)
