4- implement the user authentication:
	The authentication will be entirely managed by the proxy server. 
	When the user first gets to the website:
		What will be available:
		- the job offers will be available
		- the entreprises search will be available
		- the login view will be available
		- the map view will be available

		What will not be available:
		- the email view will not be available
		- the 'more' button will not be available(both for job offers
		  and entreprises data)
		- the Saved Offers view will not be available

Ideas of implementation:
	The search routes for the job offers and the entreprises search 
	will not need a jwt token. 
	The queries on a specific document will need a jwt token. 
	If the client gets a bad response from the server(e.g authentication
	problem), it will redirect the user to the login page with a message
	'veuillez login d'abord'. 
	The client will send the requests which needs a token with the token
	stored in the session storage. This will have two advantages:
		1- The user will not need to login anytime the page refreshes,
		2- The token expiration will result in a redirection of
		the user to the login page

That way, the email and saved job offers will be stored in elasticsearch. 
Any attempt to retrieve those documents while the user is not logged in 
will result in a redirection to the login page first, then a redirection to
the previous page with the proper data.  

Implementation:
	- The user visits the page
	- He sees the offers
	- He sees the entreprise data
	- He sees the map
	- Either he logs in, or he tries to access unauthorized data
	- Either ways, he has no token so he gets redirected to the login page


7- Big problem:
	Since the app does not have routes(only states), it brings you back on
	the main page on every refresh. Should i use a state management
	framework like redux?
